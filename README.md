A database team project for my Information Systems &amp; Decision Sciences class. 

A fictional database that can be implemented into real life applications. 
Our dataset and schemas were produced on https://mockaroo.com/ 
Which helps us randomize datasets without the trouble to find real data or insert our own.

The implementation is done on MySQL Workbench.
